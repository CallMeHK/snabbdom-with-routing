Inspired by that moment when I was looking through my vue and react build files, this repo was an experiment in making someting small, readable and functional.  Used snabbdom for rendering virtual dom, and navigo for routing.  Build file is still ~15 kb, looking for ways to make it smaller with webpack and imports.  

 - clone or download
 - `npm install`
 - `npm start` to run dev server
 - `npm run build` to build with webpack, uncomment the analyzer in webpack.config.js if interested in files sizes.
